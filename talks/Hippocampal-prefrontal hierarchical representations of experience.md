## Hippocampal representations of experience

- encoding memory and events
- past experience guides learning in the present
- individual events are building blocks of knowledge
  - new events may be stored as overlapping representations
  - or coding may emphasize differences (orthogonalization etc)
- both of these coding strategies are adaptive
- benefits of cognitive maps:
  - reason, navigation, conceptual knowledge, context-dependent decisions, imagining novel solutions
- framework:
  - mPFC: latent causes and dimensionality reduction
  - mPFC -> HC: bias encoding of goal-relevant features, selecting relevant memories, evaluating actions
  - HC: bind together associative features, differentiate features that lead to different outcomes
  - HC -> mPFC: signal associative relationships, signal prediction error

- how are commonalities and differences represented?
  - study using common representations using random 3d objects
  - does reactivation bias representation?
- there might be complementary circuits for integration and differentiation
- representational change is dependent on reactivation during learning
  - reactivation leads to more differentiation between patterns
- hierarchical cognitive maps:
  - space example: representational geometries within and between cities
  - generalization of abstract properties that support inference (e.g. airports are far from the city and universities are downtown)
  - relationships: first order (direct connections), second order (indirect through a shared connection), third order (inferring a general geometry between 3 objects)
- neural representations may code consistent relationships
- where are consistent geometry representations located? potentially HC, PFC, lateral parietal regions (also for third order relationships)
