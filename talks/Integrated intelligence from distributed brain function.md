### Integrated intelligence from distributed brain function

### Intro

- Multiple demand (MD) system for flexible intelligence - set of brain regions (frontal and parietal) associated with standard tests of fluid intelligence
- The cognitive tests incorporate many complex types of inferences - e.g. based on shape, size, color for "finish the sequence" type tasks
  - Diving complex problems into simple parts is an important feature of fluid intelligence
  - This act is present in every type of behavior (goal-subgoal decomposition)
- Attentional integration - core of cognitive control
  - Present in the Wisconsin card sorting task and other tests

### Anatomy and physiology

- Glasser, HCP - multimodal functional parcellation of the brain (180 regions)
  - based on discontinuity in multiple features
- Data from HCP (multiple demand activation):
  - Working memory (2 back vs 0 back - stream of pictures, respond if matches picture that appeared 2 pictures ago vs looking for a fixed picture)
  - Relational decision vs match - either find whether picture matches the top two in shape or texture or whether the dimension of change is the same
  - Arithmetic vs story - mathematical equations vs story and questions
- Conjunction of more demanding vs less demanding activity:
  - Reliable activations in some regions in the medial surface (AC etc), medial parietal MD region
  - Network of 27 cortical parcels
    - Core: more active than the average
- No consensus on functional preference of regions
  - Possible subgroups
- Hallmarks: broad anatomical distribution - local access, local access matches relative functional preferences
- Cognitive operations require organizing information into a structure with the right roles and relations
- Nonlinear mixed selectivity - responding to conjunctions of features (e.g. movement + color)
