## Models of the Mind by Grace Lindsay

- mathematics is a form of extended cognition
  - it lets us offload relationships to symbols
  - it also helps clarify models and make them precise and self-consistent
  - can serve as embodiment of analogy between disparate systems
  - could be too simplistic to capture biological phenomena
- spiking models
  - a cell can be described as a circuit with ions carrying charge (Lapicque)
  - action potentials - all or nothing => threshold
  - leaky integrate and fire model of the neuron 
    - has been used to model Parkinson’s
  - Hodgkin and Huxley modeled spikes using differential equations 
  - Rall - dendrites as cables 
- computing
  - “But the financial hurdle was perhaps the smallest one to overcome in getting this opus finished. Russell had to fight against his own agitation with the scholarly material. According to his autobiography, he spent days staring at a blank sheet of paper and evenings contemplating jumping in front of a train. ” 
  - Russell => Principia Mathematica, the founding basic principles of math reduced to logic
