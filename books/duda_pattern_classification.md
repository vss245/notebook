## Pattern classification 

### Chapter 1

- pattern recognition is crucial
- we seek to build systems that can recognize patterns
- example: fish packing plant
  - a camera records an array of **features** (e.g. length, width etc)
  - we also notice noise in the images due to the position of the fish, electronics etc
  - we view the two populations (e.g. seabass or salmon) as having different models
