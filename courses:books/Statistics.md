# Statistics

### Probability

- Value between 0 and 1
- Assigning a probability to each outcome - probability distribution
- Conditional probability - $P(A|B)$: probability of A given B
  - Events are independent when $P(A|B) = P(A)$
- Measures of outcomes:
  - Sensitivity: true positive
  - Specificity: true negative
  - False positive
  - Miss rate (false negative)
- Bayes theorem:
  - $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}$
- Probability depends on the sensitivity, specificity and the incidence rate

### Measures of data

- Mean: $\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i$ (central tendency)
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum(x_i-\mu)^2$ (spread of data - how far each point is from the mean)
- Mode: most frequent value
- Standard deviation: $\sigma$ (brings the units back)

### Distributions

- How often each value appears
- Skewness - measure of asymmetry of a distribution:
  - $g_p = 3(\mu-\mu_{1/2})/\sigma$: (mean - median)/std

### Hypothesis testing

- Null hypothesis: model of the system based on the assumption that the effect is due to chance
- P-value: probability of the effect under the null hypothesis
  - the fraction that represents how often the difference due to chance is as big or bigger than the observed one
