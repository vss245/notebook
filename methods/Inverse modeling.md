## Inverse modeling

- EEG/MEG signal is generated by dipoles, where the dipole moment represents neural activity
- Head models construct a realistic model of the head taking resistivity of different surfaces into account
- Dipole parameters consist of the magnitude and orientation
  - For each position $r_d$ in the head, the relation between d and V (measured potentials at m electrodes) is $V = L(r_d) * d$
  - L is the lead field matrix based on the head model
- Since there is an infinite amount of configurations of sources that could give rise to a particular pattern of activity on the sensor level, constraints must be employed
  - LCMV: unit gain and minimizing output power
  - eLORETA: smoothness (no high variability between neighboring sources)
