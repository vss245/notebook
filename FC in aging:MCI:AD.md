# Applying FC to dementia/AD

 

- AD is characterized by the accumulation of Abeta protein, hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein and neuroinflammation -> neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction

- Current biomarkers: CSF, FDG-PET and MRI volumetry

- Pathological changes appear before the first clinical symptoms

- Amyloid plaques have a toxic effect on inhibitory terminals/excitatory neurons => disrupted inhibition/excitation balance
  - Increased neuronal excitability
  - Damage to networks
- early dysfunction - hippocampal hyperactivity
- p-Tau => disrupts microtubules of axons and networks, lowers synaptic efficiency, disrupts communication - proposal: AD as a **disconnection syndrome**
- Network disruptions can be studied with MEG/EEG
  - MEG: magnetic fields induced by IPSP
  - EEG: neuronal field potentials
  - con: low access to deep structures
  - pro: MEG is reference free, non-invasive
- Advanced AD: function disconnection
- Earlier stages: communication disruption - hypersynchronization in MEG
  - resting state activity: increasing and decreasing FC in prefrontal and posterior regions (mostly 8-13 Hz)
  - MEG ML classification study - increased synchronization between anterior and posterior regions (metric: mutual information)
- Common factors in MEG studies: 
  - **spurious synchrony between prefrontal and posterior regions**, not associated with better cognitive performance
  - **hypersynchrony, then hypo synchrony** (first due to impaired excitation/inhibition balance, then due to degeneration)
  - other findings from studies: decreased alpha-range FC, higher delta activity, increased network strength
- Applying graph theory to MEG data:
  - decreased clustering and transitivity (probability of interconnection between adjacent nodes)
- EEG findings:
  - reduced alpha-beta coherence
  - reduced alpha-range interhemispheric coupling
- **Discrepancy: hypo/hyper synchrony in MEG and no hypersynchrony in EEG**
- Important marker: conversion between stages
  - markers: 
    - higher alpha band synchronization for future dementia patients
    - synchronization between the ACC and posterior regions
    - increased beta synchronization between MTL and ACC
    - increased EEG delta power in temporal regions
    - increased fronto-parietal coherence
- **Compatibility of functional network data between EEG/MEG**
- **Correlation with current biomarkers like CSF and PET**
  - correlation between high amyloid deposits and brain synchrony
    - early pre-clinical stages: hypersynchrony
    - increased alpha power
  - correlation between p-tau levels and FC between MTL and ACC in prodromal AD
  - decrease in PS between motor cortex and PCC, also between OFC and temporo-occipital cortex
- Approach: Poil et al - combining 6 EEG biomarkers
  - combining EEG/MEG findings, neuropsychological tests, lifestyle factors for a global index
