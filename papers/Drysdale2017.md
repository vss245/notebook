# Resting state connectivity biomarkers of depression subtypes

Drysdale 2017

- Depression is a heterogeneous syndrome, which has several hundred variations of changes in mood, sleep, energy etc
- Therefore, there might be multiple forms of depression, but their neurobiological basis is unknown
- Most previous studies identify clusters of symptoms and test for correlates of those, but the relationship between subtypes and substrates is variable across individuals
- Another alternative is to cluster patients by shared brain activity features 
  - rsMRI is a useful modality for this
  - depression is associated with abnormal functional connectivity in frontostriatal and limbic networks
