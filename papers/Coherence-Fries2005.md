# A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: Neuronal communication through neuronal coherence
- A mechanism for cognitive dynamics - communication through coherence
## Abstract
  - Groups of neurons active at any time
  - How do they interact?
    - Via coherence
    - Rhythmic excitability fluctuations
## Intro
- We have selective attn and cognitive control
- Anatomical connections stay unchanged on the timescale of ms, but communication is altered
- Model: neuron sends message (AP rate or degree of sync)
  - Receiving neurons combine input
  - Distribution and reception is governed by anatomy
  - However, cognition requires effective communication on top of anatomy
  - Implemented by patterns of coherence
### CTC hypothesis
  - Neuronal groups oscillate
  - Oscillations modulate excitability
  - Peaks are windows
  - Also relevant for binding perception (BBS)
### Feedforward models:
- FR:
  - Neurons communicate by changing the firing rate, receiving neurons integrate the input and modulate their FR
- Degree of spike sync:
  - Neurons are sensitive to densities of spike input (bursts)
  - Neurons of groups synchronize bursts
### Coherence
- Oscillations affect output and sensitivity
- To have effective communication:
  - Timing must be predictable (oscillations)
  - Spike travel time must be reliable (conduction velocity)
  - Sending group times the output with the open window (based on the other two)
### Frequency bands:
  - Accounting for delays is important
  - If conduction delays are on the same order as cycle length, two groups are coherent at 0 phase (send at one peak, arrive at next)
  - However, more likely that this happens within one peak
  - Gamma band = cycle length 10-30 ms, conduction delays = 1-3 ms
### Selective coherence:
  - Preclusion of communication is important
  - Global phase locking in epilepsy
  - Non-communication through non-coherence
    - Irregular oscillations (broadband) restrict spurious coherence
    - Physiological oscillations are only predictable for a few cycles
### Corticospinal coherence:
  - Hazard rate correlates with RT correlates with synchronization between muscle EMG and MEG in contralateral motor cortex
### Binding:
  - Possible scenario to test synchronization as a measure of selectivity
    - Attended visual stim induces stronger gamma band
    - If there's two inputs, the receiving neurons will get two inputs of bursts of spikes (non-synchronized)
    - Attended stimulus will be more gamma-synchronized
    
- Flexible pattern of coherence can modulate effective gain despite constant anatomical connections
- Neurons can entrain to the rhythm and made sensitive for selected input
