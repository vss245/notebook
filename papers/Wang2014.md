## A systematic framework for functional connectivity measures

- Approaches to functional coupling:

- - Functional connectivity ( statistical dependence among time series - correlation or MI)

  - - Supplemented by multivariate GC or directed transfer functions to control for indirect coupling

  - Effective connectivity - directed (casual) influence, relies on a model

- Both can be represented with a graph, where nodes are areas and edges are connections

- Simulated data is important in evaluating methods

- - 42 methods benchmarked using simulated data

- - Generative model for EEG - convolution based neural mass model (Moran 2013)

- Methods have varying sensitivity to non-linearity in the data

- Methods:

- - Correlation

  - - Based on Pearson correlations
    - Bivariate, partial, directed, undirected

  - H2 

  - - Non-linear correlation coefficients - fit a non-linear curve from a piecewise linear approximation between time series

  - MI in the time domain

  - - Estimates the shared information between two time series

  - Granger causality

  - - Directed connectivity
    - Information in the past of j helps to predict the future of signal I if j -> I
    - Methods are based on multivariate autoregressive models
    - Related methods: conditional GC (or partial) considers exogenous and/or latent variables

  - Transfer entropy

  - - J -> I if the joint information of the past of j and I can reduce the uncertainty in the future values of xi compared to the degree of uncertainty of xi from the past of xi
    - GC and TE are equivalent for gaussian variables

  - Coherence

  - - Cross-correlation in the frequency domain

  - ï»¿AH family - coefficients of the MVAR in the frequency domain
