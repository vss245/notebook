- BOLD fMRI is the dominant tool for brain activity
- brains exhibit constant fluctuations in activity not related to the task at hand
- RSFC is based on this spontaneous brain activity
- Views:
  - RSFC is associated with unconstrained cognitive processes (retrospection, prospection, environmental monitoring, planning)
    - changes in FC between rest and tasks have been interpreted as indicators of cognition
    - Problems:
      - SWS and anesthesia don't significantly change RSFC structure
      - RSFC structure is largely consistent across subjects at the population level and even across mammalian species
      - the metabolic activity of the brain is minimally affected by task performance
  - RSFC is associated with learning and memory
    - homeostatic and consolidative signalling
- learning machine theory:
  - David Marr - learning organisms alternate between a learning phase and a restorative phase (e.g. wake and sleep)
  - activity dependent synaptic plasticity plays a role in learning
  - this plasticity is substantiated by LTP or LTD
  - but unconstrained Hebbian plasticity will lead to either constant activation or constant inactivation
  - Brains need homeostatic plasticity which adjusts synaptic strength in the opposite direction (restoring to prior set points)
  - these homeostatic mechanisms can operate at multiple levels and time scales
- electrophysiology
  - consolidation takes place after events and responses
  - off-line processing: consolidation of episodic memory through place cell replay and SWR in the HC + procedural memory
  - perception, action etc are carried out online
  - thesis: off-line and on-line processing is parallel to the learning and restoration phases proposed by Marr
  - similar distinction: internally vs externally oriented states
  - some of the ongoing brain activity can be understood via this fluctuation
  - on-line activity suppresses off-line activity locally
- Functional connectivity changes are observed in the contexst of multiple training paradigms (across days or weeks)
