## Complex network measures of brain connectivity and their uses and interpretations

Rubinov and Sporns 2010

- Brain regions can be connected via anatomical tracts or functional associations
  - This can be conceptualized as a network
  - Advantages: easy to quantify & compare
- Network – a representation of complex system, has nodes and edges
  - Can be represented in a connectivity matrix
  - Influenced by choice of imaging method, parcellation, method of connectivity
  -  Issues with nodes and links:
    - Nodes typically represent brain regions and edges represent connections (directed or undirected). Ideally, nodes represent distinct brain regions, but in some methods, for example, sensor-level analysis with EEG or MEG, regions can be less distinct. 
    - Edges can be binarized (absence or presence of a connection) or weighted (strength of connection). Binary edges are easier to work with, but weighted metrics can be more meaningful
    - We may or may not want to include directionality in the model
- Network measures characterize aspects of connectivity (for the whole network or individual components)
  - Basic metrics:
    - Number of nodes and links
    - Degree – number of neighbors
      - Degree distribution, density (mean degree)
    - These metrics are useful for statistical comparisons
- In networks, we are interested in how segregated their components are (modularity), but also how integrated they are (interconnectedness)
- Measures of segregation quantifies the presence of densely interconnected separate groups
  - Clustering coefficient – the fraction of triangles around a node
  - Transitivity - same thing, but normalized for the whole network
  - Modularity – the degree to which a network can be subdivided into groups
- Measures of integration quantify interconnectedness within a network
  - Characteristic path length – average shortest path length between all nodes
  - Global efficiency – inverse of the above
  - Structural and effective networks have high efficiency, functional networks have lower efficiency
- Small world networks are supposed to reconcile segregation and integraion
  - More clustered than random networks but with the same characteristic path length
  - Prominent in anatomical networks, less so in functional (and harder to interpret)
- Other metrics
  - Motif – pattern of local connectivity
  - Centrality – importance of individual nodes
  - Degree
  - Resilience 
  - Degree distribution
  - Assortativity (how much similar nodes connect to each other)
- Examples of uses (from Journal Club):
  - Schizophrenia (van den Heuvel et al, 2010)
    - Structural networks (DTI): longer characteristic path lengths, reduction of centrality of frontal regions (i.e. less global integration)
  - Alzheimer’s disease (Supekar et al, 2008)
    - Resting state MRI: network analysis helps distinguish healthy and pathological subjects (loss of small world properties, clustering coefficient)
  - Brain development (Boersma et al, 2011)
    - Resting state EEG: development shows shift from more random to organized small-world networks (clustering, path length)
- Critique:
  - Composition of networks varies depending on method and analysis choices
  - Many studies assume the same number of nodes and edges across graphs (while pathology may reduce it for some groups)
  - Not a lot of graph metrics in common across studies
  - Hypotheses tested on a certain graph level without justification
